        <h1>USE YOUR MASK</h1>
        <p>Always make sure you use your face mask, and be sure it covers every part of your mouth and nose. With the eyes as well, these are three places the virus could infilterate into the body. Prevention of the virus is quite more important than curing it as almost 10% of those who contacted it have died.</p>

        <h1>Wash your hands</h1>
        <p>Another way to contain the virus is the always washing of ones hands. If people constantly wash their hands with soup every 20min and everyime they go out they stand a chance of not contacting the virus and therefore being able to contain the sickness. </p>

        <h1>SOCIAL DISTANCING</h1>
        <p>As much as possible, stay at home but if there is any need to go out, one must do it with cautious and the mind of not mingling with crowd or group of persons, as the virus in its initial stage does not show symptoms</p>
